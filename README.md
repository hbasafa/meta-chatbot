# meta-chatbot
A chatbot development toolkit


## Description

In this project, we want to include chatbot toolkits all in one place. To this end, we provide a generalized architecture of common and well-known chatbots like:
 - [Convlab](https://github.com/ConvLab/ConvLab)
 - [DeepPovLov](https://deeppavlov.ai/)
 - [Rasa](https://rasa.com/)

which includes both research and industrial chatbots. The goal of this project is to enable researchers and industrial developers to build, test and deploy chatbots, as well as to compare, benchmark and implement new algorithms for each part to imporve the quality of current models and systems. We also consider to provide benchmarks, results and useful links that would help begginers, experts and third-parties pick the most appropriate approach matching their needs.


## Getting started

This project is written in Python, so you need to set a virtual environment. Then install the requirements.
Finally you need to add you code as a python script, and run it. A sample ```main.py``` is located at the root.

## Test and Deploy

TBA

## Installation
No installation is required, but make sure to have a common python package manager like pip. It is also recommended to use a virtual environment to install the requirements.

## Requirements
Requirements are written in the ```requirements.txt``` file. Try install them using:
### pip
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### conda
```
cat requirements.txt | xargs -n 1 conda install
```

## Support
Face an issue? Feel free to open an issue, and discuss what's going wrong.

## Roadmap
There is some idea to do in future:
- add Rasa toolkit
- add Convlab toolkit
- add sample data
